# Mandatory Checklist

## Code validation

- [ ] I validated all the Acceptance Criteria. If possible, provide screenshots or videos.
- [ ] I triggered all changed lines of code at least once without new errors/warnings/notices.
- [ ] I implemented built-in tests to cover the new/changed code.

- [ ] I protected entry points against unexpected inputs.
- [ ] I did not introduce unnecessary complexity.
- [ ] Output messages (errors, notices, logs) are explicit enough for users to understand the issue and are actionnable.
